## Framework Structure

Patient explanation: [Simple Hinglish analogy]

### 2. Sex Therapy for Psychogenic Causes

**Example Pattern (Performance Anxiety, Stress):**

- **Root Cause:** Performance Anxiety / Stress
- **What's happening:** Mind creates pressure → Body responds with stress → Blood vessels tighten → Erection blocked
- **Therapy Approach:**
  - Relaxation techniques (breathing exercises)
  - Sensate focus (pleasure without pressure)
  - Cognitive reframing (thoughts → feelings → actions)
  - Gradual exposure therapy
- **Patient Explanation:**
  "Therapy sikhata hai kaise pressure ko handle karein, aur kaise pleasure pe focus karein performance ke jagah. Jaise driving test mein practice se confidence badhta hai, waise hi structured practice se body relax karna seekh jata hai."

---

### 3. Sex Therapy for Physiological Causes

**Example Pattern (Weak Pelvic Floor Muscles):**

- **Root Cause:** Weak Pelvic Floor Muscles
- **What's happening:** Muscles that control ejaculation are weak → Can't hold/delay → Early release
- **Therapy Approach:**
  - Kegel exercises (pelvic floor strengthening)
  - Start-stop technique
  - Squeeze technique
  - Gradual control building
- **Patient Explanation:**
  "Jaise gym mein muscles strong karte hain, waise hi specific exercises se pelvic floor muscles train hote hain. Regular practice se control badhta hai."

---

### 4. Sex Therapy for Behavioral Causes

**Example Pattern (Lifestyle/Habits - Tight Grip, Porn):**

- **Root Cause:** Habitual tight grip / Excessive porn use
- **What's happening:** Body conditioned to very specific stimulation → Normal sex doesn't match → Performance issues
- **Therapy Approach:**
  - Habit retraining (gradual grip reduction)
  - Arousal reconditioning
  - Stimulus control (reduce porn, increase real-world intimacy)
  - Scheduled practice routines
- **Patient Explanation:**
  "Body ko ek pattern ki aadat pad gayi hai. Therapy se naya pattern sikhate hain jo natural sex ke sath match karta hai. Jaise diet change karte waqt taste buds adjust hote hain, waise hi."

## Key Note

**"Essence same (Physical, Psychological, Behavioral) - emphasis varies by root cause"**

- All treatment plans combine:
  - Lifestyle modifications (sleep, exercise, diet)
  - Behavioral techniques (therapy, exercises)
  - Medical intervention when needed (medications, supplements)

- The **emphasis** changes based on root cause:
  - **Physiological → More medical + some therapy**
  - **Psychological → More therapy + some lifestyle**
  - **Behavioral → More habit change + some therapy**

## Treatment Linking Examples

### Example 1: Diabetes-Related ED

**Root Cause:** Diabetes → High blood sugar → Damaged blood vessels

**Treatment Explanation:**
"Diabetes se blood vessels ko damage hua hai, jisse blood flow kam ho gaya. Medication (Sildenafil/Tadalafil) blood vessels ko dilate karta hai aur blood flow improve karta hai. Saath mein diabetes control karna zaruri hai taaki future damage na ho."

**Therapy Component:** Lifestyle (diet, exercise) + Medication support

---

### Example 2: Performance Anxiety ED

**Root Cause:** Anxiety → Stress response → Blood vessel constriction

**Treatment Explanation:**
"Anxiety se aapka body 'fight or flight' mode mein jaata hai, jisse blood vessels tight ho jate hain. Sex therapy sikhata hai kaise relaxation techniques use karein, pressure kam karein, aur natural arousal pe focus karein. Short-term medication (optional) confidence building ke liye."

**Therapy Component:** Cognitive therapy + Relaxation training + Optional medication

---

### Example 3: Premature Ejaculation (Behavioral)

**Root Cause:** Tight grip habit → Hypersensitivity/conditioning

**Treatment Explanation:**
"Tight grip se body ko ek specific pattern ki aadat pad gayi hai. Therapy mein hum grip ko gradually normal karte hain, pelvic floor exercises karte hain, aur arousal management sikhate hain. Topical options (delay sprays) temporary support de sakte hain training ke sath."

**Therapy Component:** Habit retraining + Pelvic exercises + Topical support

## For AI: How to Use This

1. **Identify Root Cause Category** (Physical/Psychological/Behavioral)
2. **Match to Treatment Framework**
3. **Explain WHY this treatment works for THIS cause**
4. **Use simple analogies** (from Analogies document)
5. **Link medication/therapy to mechanism**
6. **Give hope** - emphasize treatability

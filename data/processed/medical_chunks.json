Neurological causes also include \nstroke and partial complex seizures.\n\n​ Medications - Some drugs, including certain antihypertensives, \nantidepressants, and antipsychotics, can cause ED as a side effect. \n​ Obesity – Excess body weight is associated with vascular disease, diabetes, \nand hormonal imbalances, all of which can contribute to ED. \n \n \n​ Psychological Causes \n​ Stress, anxiety and Depression - Mental health issues like stress, anxiety and \ndepression can interfere with sexual arousal and performance. High levels of \nstress and anxiety can interfere with sexual arousal and the ability to achieve \nan erection. Performance anxiety, in particular, can create a cycle of ongoing \nerectile difficulties. Depression can reduce libido and impair the neurological \npathways involved in sexual arousal. \n​ Relationship Issues- Interpersonal conflicts and lack of communication with a \npartner can affect sexual performance. \n \n​ Environmental and Lifestyle Causes \n​ Smoking, Alcohol and Substance abuse - Smoking can damage blood vessels \nand reduce blood flow to the penis. Excessive alcohol consumption and drug \nuse can also impair erectile function. \n​ Lack of Physical Activity - Sedentary lifestyles are associated with obesity, \ncardiovascular disease, and reduced blood flow, all of which can contribute to \nED. \n​ Poor Diet - Diets high in saturated fats, sugars, and processed foods can lead \nto obesity, diabetes, and vascular disease, increasing the risk of ED. \n​ Sleep Disorders - Conditions such as sleep apnea can affect hormone levels \nand blood flow, leading to erectile difficulties. \n \n​ Anatomical and Structural Causes \n​ Peyronie’s Disease - The development of fibrous scar tissue inside the penis \ncan cause curved, painful erections and difficulty maintaining an erection. \n​ Penile Injuries - Trauma or injury to the penis, pelvis, or perineum can damage \nthe vascular and nerve structures involved in erection. \n​ Surgery - Surgeries involving the prostate, bladder, or colon can damage \nnerves and blood vessels critical to erectile function. \n \n​ Types of Erections \n \n​ Reflexogenic Erection – This happens when someone touches the genitals and \ntriggers arousal.

This type of erection happens without physical touch. ​ Nocturnal Erection – This erection happens when you’re asleep. These occur more \ncommonly during the deep stages of sleep.\n\n​ Types of Erectile Dysfunctions \nThere are different types of erectile dysfunction (ED): \n​ Primary ED, the man has never been able to attain or sustain an erection \n​ Secondary ED, acquired later in life by a man who previously was able to attain \nerections \n​ Situational ED, where because of a certain situation, a man is unable to have or \nmaintain an erection \nPrimary ED is rare and is almost always due to psychological factors or clinically obvious \nanatomic abnormalities. \nSecondary ED is more common, and > 90% of cases have an organic etiology. Many men \nwith secondary ED develop reactive psychologic difficulties that compound the problem. \nPsychologic factors, whether primary or reactive, must be considered in every case of ED. \nPsychologic causes of primary ED include guilt, fear of intimacy, depression, or anxiety. In \nsecondary ED, causes may relate to performance anxiety, stress, or depression. Psychogenic \nED may be situational, involving a particular place, time, or partner. \nSituational ED is a form of ED that occurs only during certain circumstances. For example, \nsome men may have trouble maintaining an erection with a partner but not during \nmasturbation. Psychological factors, such as nervousness or performance anxiety often cause \nit. Targeting the psychological cause is usually the best treatment option in these cases. \nAlcohol and drug use can also lead to situational ED. \n \n​ Physiology of an Erection \nAn erection begins with sensory and mental stimulation in your brain. \nYour brain sends messages to your penis via your nerves. \n \nEssentially, these messages tell the muscles of your corpora cavernosa \n(this contains the sponge-like material) to relax, allowing blood to flow in \nand fill the open spaces. When the blood vessels of the corpora cavernosa \nrelax and open up, blood rushes in to fill them. The blood then gets \ntrapped under high pressure by a series of valves, creating an erection. \n \nThe tunica albuginea (a membrane surrounding the corpora cavernosa), \nhelps to trap the blood in the corpora cavernosa, so you stay hard.\n\nAn erection is reversed when muscles in your penis contract, stopping the \nflow of blood. The pressure decreases and the valves open, letting the \nblood flow out. Your penis loses its erection and becomes flaccid (soft). \n \n​ Anatomy of a Penis \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n​ The penis is made of three major parts: the base, shaft and glans. The base and glans \nform the portions closest and furthest away from the body, respectively. The shaft \nforms the main body of the penis. \n​ The base attaches the penis to the body via the bony pelvis. \n​ The shaft consists of the corpora cavernosa, the corpus spongiosum, and a sturdy \nlayer of fat and skin.",

The shaft \nforms the main body of the penis. ​ The base attaches the penis to the body via the bony pelvis. ​ The shaft consists of the corpora cavernosa, the corpus spongiosum, and a sturdy \nlayer of fat and skin.\n\n​ The corpora cavernosa are paired cylinders of erectile tissue and provide the erectile \nproperties of the penis. They are made of a spongey tissue with a lattice-like structure \nthat is able to fill with blood to produce an erection. \n​ The corpus spongiosum is close to the surface of the penis and encloses the urethra. It \nalso consists of a sponge-like tissue and, when filled with blood during an erection, \nhelps to keep the urethra open. \n​ The glans is found at the tip of the penis and, in uncircumcized men, is covered by the \nforeskin. \n​ Degree of Hardness of Erection \n \nThe Erection Hardness Scale (EHS), an easy-to-use, four-point scale for erectile dysfunction \n(ED), provides a reliable measure of erection hardness and an indicator of other health and \nwellbeing outcomes, according to new data reported at the European Association of Urology. \nEHS rates the hardness of erection on a scale of one to four, with four being the maximal \nscore. The language used is simple and direct so that men with ED can use the scale to assess \nthe severity of their condition and to monitor the impact of treatment. A score of 1 indicates \nthat the penis is larger than normal, but not hard; 2 means the penis is hard, but not hard \nenough for penetration, 3 means the penis is hard enough for penetration but not completely \nhard, and 4 indicates that the penis is completely hard and fully rigid. \n \nDegree of Erection Hardness: The Erection Hardness Score (EHS) \nThe Erection Hardness Score (EHS) is a widely used tool to assess the quality and firmness \nof an erection. It provides a simple yet effective way to gauge erectile function, particularly in \nclinical settings and studies. The EHS ranges from 1 to 4, with each score representing a \ndifferent level of erection hardness. Here’s a detailed look at each degree: \nEHS 1: Penis is Larger but Not Hard \n-Description: The penis is enlarged but not firm. It does not have sufficient rigidity for \npenetration. This level often indicates significant erectile dysfunction. \n- Experience: The erection is comparable to a cooked noodle. It may be visually noticeable \nbut cannot sustain any sexual activity. \n- Implications: EHS 1 often suggests serious blood flow or nerve function issues. It can be \nrelated to severe vascular problems, significant psychological distress, or advanced \nneuropathy. \n- Treatment Considerations: Requires medical evaluation to determine underlying causes \nand may necessitate interventions like medications, lifestyle changes, or therapy. \n \n EHS 2: Penis is Hard but Not Hard Enough for Penetration",

EHS 2: Penis is Hard but Not Hard Enough for Penetration\n\n- Description: The penis is firmer and can expand, but it is not sufficiently rigid to enable \npenetration. This erection level may be sufficient for non-penetrative sexual activities but not \nfor intercourse. \n- Experience: The erection is akin to a peeled banana or a semi-soft state. It shows partial \nfirmness but bends easily. \n- Implications: EHS 2 can indicate moderate erectile dysfunction. It might be due to factors \nlike partial vascular insufficiency, mild hormonal imbalances, or stress-related issues. \n- Treatment Considerations: Often responds to oral medications (like PDE5 inhibitors), \ntherapy for psychological factors, or lifestyle modifications. Further assessment is required to \nidentify specific causes. \n \n EHS 3: Penis is Hard Enough for Penetration but Not Completely Hard \n- Description: The penis is firm enough to allow penetration but does not reach full rigidity. \nIt can sustain intercourse but may feel less firm than desired. \n- Experience: This erection is similar to an unpeeled banana. It is mostly hard but slightly \nsoft, especially at the base. \n- Implications: EHS 3 indicates mild erectile dysfunction or a temporary issue. It may be \nassociated with factors like mild cardiovascular issues, stress, or side effects of medications. \n-Treatment Considerations: Generally manageable with lifestyle adjustments, stress \nmanagement, or medications. Improving cardiovascular health and reducing stress can \nenhance firmness. \n \nEHS 4: Penis is Completely Hard and Fully Rigid \n- Description: The penis is completely rigid and fully hard, providing optimal conditions for \npenetration and sustaining intercourse. This level of hardness is considered normal and ideal. \n- Experience: The erection is as hard as a cucumber, fully firm, and upright. \n-Implications: EHS 4 indicates normal erectile function without significant underlying \nissues.

Upon receiving \nsignals from the brain, the blood vessels, nerves, and hormones work together to cause and \nmaintain an erection.\n\nThe soft (flaccid) penis - If nothing is causing a man to become aroused, then his body's \nerection \"team\" of brain, nerves, blood vessels, and hormones won't begin working to cause \nan erection. The amount of blood flowing into the penis's spongy chambers (corpora \ncavernosa and corpus spongiosum) equals the amount flowing out. His penis remains soft. \nThe swollen (tumescent) penis - A man becomes aroused through his senses (such as sight \nor touch) or his thoughts (such as memories or fantasies). During arousal, messages brought \nby nerves cause the blood vessels and spongy chambers to dilate (open up). More blood flows \ninto his penis than flows out. His penis starts to swell. \nThe erect (rigid) penis - As arousal continues, nerves keep carrying messages of arousal \nbetween the penis and the brain. Blood keeps moving into the man's penis. Blood-swollen \ntissues press against the veins. Some of the blood is kept from flowing back out. Filled with \nblood, his penis becomes rigid. The man can have intercourse. \n \n​ How hormone levels affect Erectile Dysfunction \n \na.​ Testosterone \nTestosterone is the primary male sex hormone. In men it is mainly produced by the \ntesticles and its production is controlled by the brain (the hypothalamus and the \npituitary gland). The erectile bodies (the corpus cavernosa) have receptors for \ntestosterone and it is well known that this hormone plays an important role in their \nstructure and function. These erectile bodies are responsible for generating penile \nerections – a process co-dependent on a complex interaction of psychological, neural, \nvascular and hormonal factors. Certain conditions can cause testosterone deficiency \n(hypogonadism in medical jargon), a situation in which the body fails to produce \nenough of this hormone. \nNormal Testosterone Levels- Normal testosterone level in males is considered to be \n300-1000 ng/dl (nanograms per decilitre). According to the American Urological \nAssociation (AUA), you have low testosterone if your level is below 300 ng/dL when \nyou're tested twice on separate occasions. Some doctors, though, think levels below \n250 ng/dL should be considered low. \n \nCentral Nervous System Effects \n \n​ Libido and Sexual Desire: Testosterone significantly influences sexual desire \n(libido). It acts on the brain, particularly in regions such as the hypothalamus \nand limbic system, which are involved in the regulation of sexual behavior. \nHigher levels of testosterone enhance sexual thoughts and fantasies, which can \nlead to increased sexual arousal and the initiation of the erectile process. \n​ Neurotransmitter Modulation: Testosterone affects the levels and activity of \nseveral neurotransmitters, including dopamine and nitric oxide (NO). \nIncreased dopamine levels, stimulated by testosterone, enhance sexual arousal \nand contribute to the initiation and maintenance of an erection. \nPeripheral Effects",

Increased dopamine levels, stimulated by testosterone, enhance sexual arousal \nand contribute to the initiation and maintenance of an erection. Peripheral Effects\n\n​ NO Production: Testosterone enhances the release of NO from endothelial \ncells and nerve endings in the penile tissue. NO is a key vasodilator that \ntriggers the relaxation of smooth muscle cells in the corpus cavernosum, \nthe sponge-like regions of erectile tissue. \n​ cGMP Pathway Activation: NO activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, \nwhich increases the levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). \nElevated cGMP levels cause the smooth muscle cells to relax, leading to \nthe dilation of blood vessels and increased blood flow into the corpus \ncavernosum. This process is crucial for achieving an erection. \nVascular Effects \n​ Endothelial Function: Testosterone improves endothelial function, which \nis critical for the health of blood vessels. Healthy endothelium enhances \nNO production and release, facilitating the vasodilation required for an \nerection. \n​ Penile Blood Flow: By promoting NO production and improving \nendothelial function, testosterone ensures adequate blood flow to the penis. \nEnhanced blood flow fills the corpus cavernosum, leading to the swelling \nand rigidity necessary for an erection. \n \nPrimary Testosterone Deficiency: When testosterone deficiency is caused by a failure \nof the testicles to make enough testosterone, it is referred to as a ‘primary testosterone \ndeficiency’, which might trigger ED. In blood tests, this condition is characterized by \nlow testosterone levels and high levels of the hormones LH and FSH (Follicle – \nStimulating Hormone). \nPrimary testosterone deficiency occurs in 1-2% of older men. \nSecondary Testosterone Deficiency: Testosterone deficiency can also be caused due to \na problem in the parts of the brain (the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland) which \nproduce hormones that stimulate the testicles to make testosterone. This condition is \ncalled ‘secondary testosterone deficiency’, which means that the testicles are \nfunctioning well but they fail to produce testosterone due to a hormonal imbalance at \nthe level of the brain. A secondary deficiency is characterized by low testosterone \nblood levels and low-normal blood levels of LH and FSH. \n \n \nb.​ Prolactin \nProlactin is an important hormone that supports many actions and processes that \nhappen in the body every day, including the creation of blood vessels. An increase in \nprolactin hormone in the blood is associated with erectile dysfunction, decline in \nlibido and other problems with sexual function, as higher concentration of prolactin \nsuppresses testosterone production. Prolactin production can be elevated due to \nvarious causes, including hypothyroidism, the use of certain medications and more \nrarely a benign tumor in the pituitary gland. \nNormal prolactin level in males is less than 20 nanograms per millilitre (ng/mL). \n \n \nc.​ Estrogen",

Normal prolactin level in males is less than 20 nanograms per millilitre (ng/mL). c.​ Estrogen\n\nThere are cases where the age-related decline in testosterone levels among men aged \n40 and above, leads to a gradual elevation in estrogen levels which causes hormonal \nimbalance. Liver disease might likewise cause an increase in estrogen levels among \nmen. This testosterone-estrogen imbalance (also known as estrogen dominance) might \ngive rise to ED, including a reduction in spontaneous and nocturnal erections and high \nstress levels. \n \n \nd.​ Cortisol \nCortisol is a steroid hormone that regulates a wide range of important processes in the \nbody, including metabolism and the immune response. It is commonly known as the \n“stress hormone” because its production increases at times of high mental or physical \nstress. Cortisol levels gradually rise with age after the age of 40. High cortisol levels \ncan disrupt hormonal balance and suppress testosterone production. In addition, high \ncortisol levels are associated with narrowed arteries and penile blood flow restriction. \nThis is why chronic high cortisol levels can lead to ED. \n \nAdditionally, our brain triggers cortisol release in response to many different kinds of \nstress, including injury, surgery, diseases (diabetes, Parkinson’s, Cushing’s syndrome \netc.’). Smoking, excessive alcohol consumption and drug use can cause chronic \ncortisol elevation and ED. \n \n​Diabetes and Erectile Dysfunction \nDiabetes mellitus (DM), a chronic metabolic disease characterized by elevated blood glucose \nlevels, is among the most common chronic diseases. The incidence and prevalence of DM \nhave been increasing over the years. The complications of DM represent a serious health \nproblem. The prevalence of ED is approximately 3.5‐fold higher in men with DM than in \nthose without DM. Common risk factors for the development of DM and its complications \ninclude a sedentary lifestyle, overweight/obesity, and increased caloric consumption. \nThe connection between diabetes and ED is related to your circulation and nervous system. \nPoorly controlled blood sugar levels can damage small blood vessels and nerves. Damage to \nthe nerves that control sexual stimulation and response can impede a man’s ability to achieve \nan erection firm enough to have sexual intercourse. Reduced blood flow from damaged blood \nvessels can also contribute to ED. \nHow long does it take for diabetes to cause ED? \nResearch suggests that about half of men who are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes will \ndevelop ED within 10 years of their diagnosis. However, there are ways to overcome ED \nthrough lifestyle changes that involve a healthy diet, getting regular exercise, and not \nsmoking. \nAn estimated 10 percent of men ages 40 to 70 have severe ED, and another 25 percent have \nmoderate ED. ED tends to become more common as men age, though it isn’t an inevitable \npart of aging. For many men, other health conditions, such as diabetes, contribute to the \nlikelihood of developing ED.",

For many men, other health conditions, such as diabetes, contribute to the \nlikelihood of developing ED.\n\nHowever, the results suggest that if you have diabetes but adopt a healthier lifestyle, you may \nreduce your diabetes symptoms and improve your sexual health. These lifestyle habits \ninclude eating a balanced diet and getting regular exercise. \n \n​How do anti-depressants affect erection in men? \nCommon side effects of anti-depressants in men include decreased libido and difficulty \ngetting an erection. Some men have trouble maintaining an erection. Men taking \nantidepressants also report delayed or blocked orgasm. Some drugs, like Celexa, can cause a \nman’s sperm count to drop to nearly zero. The main classes of antidepressants are the \ntricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), SSRIs, SNRIs, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), \nand the atypical antidepressants. SSRIs increase serotonin by inhibiting its reuptake, which \ncan reduce sexual arousal and delay ejaculation. High serotonin levels can suppress \ndopamine, a neurotransmitter essential for sexual arousal and erection. Some antidepressants \nalso affect noradrenaline levels, which can impact sexual function by altering the balance of \nneurotransmitters involved in arousal and erection. \n \n​How does smoking affect erection? \nEndothelial Dysfunction: Smoking damages the endothelium, the inner lining of blood \nvessels. This damage impairs the production of nitric oxide, a critical molecule for \nvasodilation. Without sufficient nitric oxide, blood vessels cannot relax properly, leading to \nreduced blood flow to the penis, which is essential for achieving an erection. \nAtherosclerosis: Smoking accelerates the process of atherosclerosis, the buildup of plaques \nin arteries. These plaques can narrow the penile arteries, restricting blood flow and making it \ndifficult to achieve and sustain an erection. \nNerve Damage: Smoking can cause neuropathy or damage to the nerves, including those \nresponsible for the signalling processes involved in erection. This can disrupt the \ncommunication between the brain and the erectile tissues, making it harder to achieve an \nerection. \nLower Testosterone Levels: Studies suggest that smoking can lower testosterone levels, \nwhich are crucial for libido and erectile function. Lower testosterone can reduce sexual desire \nand impair the mechanisms necessary for erection. \nIncreased Cortisol Levels: Smoking elevates cortisol, the stress hormone, which can disrupt \nthe balance of other hormones like testosterone and impair erectile function by inducing \nstress and anxiety. \nThe toxins in cigarette smoke, such as nicotine and carbon monoxide, reduce the availability \nof nitric oxide, which is essential for relaxing the smooth muscles in the corpora cavernosa \nand allowing them to fill with blood.",

These cells must relax to allow the corpora cavernosa to fill \nwith blood. Damage to these cells can lead to poor erectile response. \nStress and Anxiety: Smoking is often used as a coping mechanism for stress, which can \nexacerbate anxiety. High levels of stress and anxiety are common contributors to erectile \ndysfunction (ED). \nBody Image and Self-Esteem: Smokers may experience lower self-esteem or negative body \nimage due to the physical effects of smoking, such as poor stamina or odor, which can affect \nsexual performance and confidence, further impacting erectile function. \nRespiratory Issues: Smoking causes respiratory problems, including chronic obstructive \npulmonary disease (COPD). Poor respiratory function can lead to reduced stamina and \nenergy, indirectly affecting sexual performance and the ability to maintain an erection. \n \n​How does alcohol affect Erection? \nProblems with orgasms \nAlcohol interferes with your ability to feel sexual stimulation. It does this by interfering with \nthe signals between the brain and the genitals. Alcohol lowers hormone levels, including \ntestosterone. It also damages cells in your testes. Even mild damage may prevent you from \ngetting or maintaining an erection. \n \n \nAfter heavy drinking, you may: \n \n​ find it hard to ejaculate (come) or may ejaculate too fast \n​ find it harder to have an orgasm, or have less intense orgasms \n \nSex drive (libido) \nDrinking heavily over a long period can lead to a lower sex drive (libido). This is because it \nreduces your levels of testosterone. \nShrinking of sex organs \nHigh-risk drinking over a long time can cause the testes and penis to shrink. \nFertility \nLowered testosterone can affect sperm production. This can reduce fertility. \nSexually transmitted infections (STIs)\n\nAlcohol lowers your inhibitions and affects your judgment. This increases your chances of \nhaving unprotected sex. This puts you at risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). \nWhat is considered heavy alcohol use? \nHeavy alcohol use is a pattern of drinking that is dangerous for a person’s health and \nwell-being. It refers both to how much and how often a person drinks. Heavy drinking is \ndefined as: \n​ Having 4 or more standard alcoholic drinks per day (or more than 14 drinks per \nweek) for male people \n​ Having 3 or more standard alcoholic drinks per day (or more than 7 drinks per \nweek) for female people \nWhen it comes to defining heavy alcohol use, the amount you drink matters. What you \npurchase at a bar or in the store may contain more alcohol than one standard drink. This \nmeans that you may be drinking more than you think you are. \nA standard drink refers to: \n​ 1.5 oz of liquor \n​ 5 oz of wine \n​ 8 oz of malt liquor \n​ 12 oz of beer \nEach of these drinks contains approximately 14 g of pure alcohol. If you order a double shot \nof liquor, which is 3 oz, then you are actually consuming two drinks. If a person is drinking \nmore than the daily or weekly limits of standard drinks listed above, then they are engaging \nin heavy alcohol use. \n \n​How do recreational drugs affect erection? \nRecreational drugs are chemical substances taken for enjoyment rather than for medical \nreasons. Alcohol, tobacco and caffeine can be classed as recreational drugs but are not \ncovered in this leaflet. Recreational drugs are usually started to provide pleasure, or improve \nlife in some way. However, they can lead to addiction, to health and social problems and to \ncrime.",

This is, perhaps unsurprisingly, highly inadvisable. \nIt’s a cocktail that can result in dangerous adverse effects and more alarmingly, this kind of \ndrug use is linked to high-risk sexual behaviours (such as unprotected sex and/or sex with \nmultiple partners), and transmission of STIs including HIV and other blood-borne viruses. \n \nMethamphetamine (Meth) \nMethamphetamine, or crystal meth, increases the amount of the natural chemical dopamine in \nthe brain making users exhilarated, alert and awake. The risks though are immense, including \nsevere depression, dental problems (AKA meth mouth) and psychosis. Sexual aggression \nand compulsive sexual behaviors are common amongst male users, with many reportedly \nusing sildenafil. This suggests that methamphetamine may cause erectile dysfunction or that \nthe behaviours it promotes necessitates its use. \n \n​Hormone Binding Agents and Erectile Dysfunction \nA hormone binding agent is a substance that interacts with specific hormones by binding to \nthem, thereby affecting their activity, availability, and overall function within the body. These \nagents can either enhance or inhibit the action of hormones, depending on their nature and the \ncontext of their use. Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG) is a glycoprotein produced \nprimarily by the liver that binds to sex hormones, specifically testosterone and estradiol (a \nform of estrogen), in the bloodstream. By binding to these hormones, SHBG regulates their \nbioavailability and activity in the body. Although SHBG binds 3 hormones, the hormone \nthat's critical in this test is testosterone. SHBG controls the amount of testosterone that your \nbody tissues can use. Too little testosterone in males and too much testosterone in females \ncan cause problems. The level of SHBG in your blood changes because of factors such as sex \nand age. It can also change because of obesity, liver disease, and hyperthyroidism.  \n \n​Role of Blood Pressure in Erectile Dysfunction",

It can also change because of obesity, liver disease, and hyperthyroidism. ​Role of Blood Pressure in Erectile Dysfunction\n\nHigh blood pressure is a major cause of erection problems. A study in the Journal of the \nAmerican Geriatrics Society found that about 49% of men ages 40 to 79 with high blood \npressure had erectile dysfunction. High blood pressure keeps the arteries that carry blood \ninto the penis from dilating the way they're supposed to. It also makes the smooth muscle in \nthe penis lose its ability to relax. As a result, not enough blood flows into the penis to make it \nerect. Men with high blood pressure may also have a low testosterone level. Testosterone is \nthe male hormone that plays a big role in sexual arousal. High blood pressure by itself can \nlead to erectile dysfunction. But some drugs for treating high blood pressure can actually be \nthe cause as well. \nED is an occasional side effect of BP drugs like thiazide diuretics, loop diuretics, and \nbeta-blockers, all of which can decrease blood flow to the penis and make it difficult to get an \nerection. However, other BP drugs, such as alpha-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and \nangioten-sin-receptor blockers, rarely cause ED. Some research even suggests the effect of \nblood pressure drugs may be more psychological than physical. When ED occurs after a man \nbegins to take a new medication, it's possible that anxiety about his health, rather than the \nmedication, may trigger the problem. And being aware of possible side effects may make a \nman more likely to recognize them as abnormal. \nNormal Blood Pressure Range for Men – 120/80 mm Hg. \n \n​Role of Cholesterol in Erectile Dysfunction \nCholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance in the bloodstream. We have both ‘good cholesterol’ \n(called HDL) and ‘bad cholesterol’ (called LDL). When there is too much LDL in the \nbloodstream, plaque is created in the arteries which blocks proper blood flow. When these \ncirculation issues occur in the genital area and penis, erectile dysfunction or erection \nproblems can occur. The more LDL you have in your bloodstream, the greater the chance of \ndeveloping erection problems or impotence. \nHigh cholesterol also affects the body’s ability to properly release nitric oxide into the \nbloodstream. Nitric oxide is needed to allow for the proper relaxation of the penile tissue that \nleads to the blood flow that creates the erection. \nAdditionally, high cholesterol is linked to lowered testosterone production. Testosterone is \nthe primary sex hormone in men, controlling sexual drive and desire, and is needed for \nbeginning and maintaining an erection. The testicles produce the body’s testosterone, and \nhigh cholesterol limits blood flow to the testicles. As a result, too much cholesterol may \ndamage their ability to produce testosterone, which can lead to ED. However, common \nmedications that are effective for reducing cholesterol by decreasing lipids in the body can \nalso lead to symptoms of erectile dysfunction. \nNormal cholesterol levels \nType of \ncholesterol \nAnyone 19 or \nyounger \nMales aged 20 \nor over \nFemales aged 20 \nor over\n\nTotal cholesterol \nless than 170 \nmg/dl \n125–200 mg/dl \n125–200 mg/dl \nNon-HDL \nless than 120 \nmg/dl \nless than 130 \nmg/dl \nless than 130 mg/dl \nLDL \nless than 100 \nmg/dl \nless than 100 \nmg/dl \nless than 100 mg/dl \nHDL \nmore than 45 \nmg/dl \n40 mg/dl or \nhigher \n50 mg/dl or higher",

The term “morning erection” is commonly used to describe erections that occur as a \nman is waking up. \nThe formal name for morning erections is nocturnal penile tumescence (NPT). The word \nnocturnal is used because morning erections are typically the last in a series of erections that \noccur as a man sleeps. \nMen can experience morning erections at any age, but it is less and less common as age \nincreases. This is a gradual process, meaning as a man’s hormones slowly decrease with age, \nso does his likelihood of having morning erections, also known as nocturnal erections. \nWhat causes morning erections? \nRather than being caused by sexual arousal, nocturnal erections are caused by regular \nfunctions of the male reproductive system. \nIn REM sleep, the deepest sleep stage in the cycle, the body’s parasympathetic nervous \nsystem is activated. This system is responsible for rest, as opposed to the sympathetic nervous \nsystem, which is responsible for your fight or flight response. The parasympathetic nervous \nsystem is also activated during sexual arousal. \nWhile men are in REM sleep they can experience spikes in hormones, which may be a trigger \nfor nocturnal erections. Together, the parasympathetic nervous system, the male reproductive \nsystem, and REM sleep all affect a man’s likelihood of having nocturnal erections. \nNot all men experience regular morning erections though.

What is it a sign of? Morning erections are a positive sign indicating health in all of these \nareas:\n\nTestosterone - Healthy male reproductive system isn’t complete without healthy \ntestosterone levels. Testosterone reaches peak levels first thing in the morning, which is \noften enough to cause an erection even without physical stimulation. This means your \nmorning erection is an indication that testosterone levels are healthy. \nSexual Health - Sexual health for men includes the ability to have and maintain an \nerection. Presence of an erection in the morning means firstly that you are capable of an \nerection, a sign of sexual health. A complete lack of morning erections may signify some \nform of erectile dysfunction. \nBlood Flow- Erections are partially caused by changes in blood flow to the penis. Blood \nfills small chambers in the penis called erectile tissue, resulting in an erection. Healthy \nblood flow to and from the erectile tissue results in healthy erections. If blood flow \nbecomes blocked in any way, it can cause a condition called priapism, resulting in painful \nerections that last irregularly long and can even result in permanent damage. \nNerve Health- Erections are caused by the parasympathetic nervous system, the system in \ncharge of the “rest” state of your body. This is opposite to the sympathetic nervous system, \nresponsible for your fight or flight response. Experiencing nocturnal erections or morning \nerections is a sign that your parasympathetic nervous system is functioning well. \n \n \n​Treatments of Erectile Dysfunction \n \nErectile Dysfunction (ED) is the inability to achieve or maintain an erection sufficient for \nsatisfactory sexual performance. It can result from various physical, psychological, or \nlifestyle factors. Effective treatment requires a comprehensive approach, often combining \nmultiple strategies. \nLifestyle and Behavioral Changes \n​ Healthy Diet and Weight Management: \n○​ Benefits: Improves cardiovascular health, reduces ED risk factors like \ndiabetes and high blood pressure. \n○​ Actions: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and \nlean proteins. Avoid excessive fats and sugars. \n​ Regular Exercise: \n○​ Benefits: Enhances blood flow, boosts stamina, reduces stress, and helps \nmaintain a healthy weight. \n○​ Actions: Engage in aerobic activities (e.g., walking, running, swimming) and \nstrength training regularly. \n​ Quit Smoking: \n○​ Benefits: Improves vascular health and blood flow to the penis.",

    "text": "Premature Ejaculation \nTraining Module \n \nPremature ejaculation occurs in men when semen leaves the body (ejaculate) sooner than \nwanted during sex. \nThe ejaculation time considered to be premature for Indian men has been found to be within \napproximately 1 minute of vaginal penetration. (However, it varies from man to man and can \nbe considered subjective). \n \nSymptoms of Premature Ejaculation \n​ Always or nearly always ejaculate within 1 minute of penetration. \n​ Unable to delay ejaculation during sex all or nearly all the time. \n​ Significant personal distress and frustration due to the inability to control ejaculation. \n \nPhysiology of Ejaculation \nEjaculation, the release of sperm cells and seminal plasma from the male reproductive \nsystem. Ejaculation takes place in two phases: in the first, or emission, stage, sperm are \nmoved from the testes and the epididymis (where the sperm are stored) to the beginning of \nthe urethra, a hollow tube running through the penis that transports either sperm or urine; in \nthe second stage, ejaculation proper, the semen is moved through the urethra and expelled \nfrom the body. \nSensory information from the penis and other genital areas is transmitted to the spinal cord \nvia afferent nerves. These sensory signals are processed and integrated in the spinal cord. \nWithin the spinal cord, particularly in the lumbar and sacral regions, there are integration \ncenters that process the sensory input related to sexual stimulation. These centers are \nresponsible for coordinating the complex reflexes involved in ejaculation. The spinal cord \nsends motor signals through efferent pathways to the muscles involved in ejaculation. This \nincludes the muscles of the pelvic floor, the vas deferens (which transports sperm), and the \nmuscles controlling the urethra. \nSperm cells that are stored in the male body are not capable of self-movement because of the \nacidity of the accompanying fluids. When the sperm receive fluids, called seminal plasma, \nfrom the various internal accessory organs (prostate gland, ejaculatory ducts, seminal \nvesicles, and bulbourethral glands), the acidity decreases. As they leave the body, the sperm \nreceive oxygen, which is vital to motility. Unable to leave the male body by their own \nmotivation, the sperm cells are transported by muscular contractions. During the emission \nphase, the muscles around the epididymis and ductus deferens (the tube extending from the \nepididymis) contract to push the sperm into the prostate and urethra. During ejaculation, \nthe semen is expelled by strong spasmodic contractions of the bulbocavernosus muscle, \nwhich encircles the corpus spongiosum (the structure in the penis that encloses the urethra).",

Inflammation can lead to hypersensitivity and altered sensations in \nthe genital and pelvic areas. Discomfort and pain associated with UTIs can \nlead to anxiety and stress during sexual activity, potentially contributing to PE. \n \n​ Weak Pelvic Muscles: The pelvic floor muscles play a key role in controlling \nejaculation. These muscles contract rhythmically during ejaculation and help \nin controlling the timing of the ejaculatory process. Weakness in these muscles \ncan reduce the ability to control ejaculation, leading to quicker release. Weak \npelvic floor muscles can lead to a lack of control over the ejaculatory reflex, \nresulting in PE. Strengthening these muscles through pelvic floor exercises \n(Kegels) can improve control and delay ejaculation. \n \n​ Sensitivity of the Penis: The glans penis is rich in sensory receptors, \nprimarily involved in detecting tactile stimuli. These receptors play a \nsignificant role in sexual arousal and ejaculation. Heightened sensitivity of \nthese receptors can lead to rapid stimulation and quicker ejaculation. Increased \npenile sensitivity can trigger the ejaculatory reflex prematurely. Topical \nanesthetics can reduce sensitivity and help in delaying ejaculation by numbing \nthe skin of the penis. \n \n​ Infections (Bacterial and Fungal): Bacterial and fungal infections in the \ngenital area can cause inflammation and irritation, affecting the tissues \ninvolved in ejaculation. Infections can lead to heightened sensitivity and \ndiscomfort in the genital area, potentially triggering premature ejaculation. \nBacterial infections, such as prostatitis, can cause inflammation of the prostate \nand surrounding tissues, leading to increased urgency and sensitivity. Fungal \ninfections, such as candidiasis, can cause itching and irritation, contributing to \nquicker ejaculation. \n \n​ Vitamin B12 Deficiency: Vitamin B12 is essential for maintaining healthy \nnerve function, including those involved in the ejaculatory reflex. B12 \ndeficiency can disrupt neurotransmitter synthesis, potentially affecting mood \nand ejaculatory control. Symptoms of B12 deficiency, such as fatigue and \nweakness, can impact overall sexual stamina and performance.

D3 deficiency can disrupt endocrine function, including\n\ntestosterone production, which may impact sexual health. Low D3 levels are \nassociated with mood disorders, which can affect sexual performance and \nsatisfaction. D3 deficiency-related muscle weakness may affect pelvic floor \nmuscles involved in ejaculatory control. Disrupted testosterone levels due to \nD3 deficiency can contribute to sexual dysfunctions, including PE. \n \n​ Psychological Causes \n​ Masturbation Addiction: Frequent or aggressive masturbation can \ndesensitize the penis, leading to quicker ejaculation during partnered sexual \nactivity. Guilt, anxiety, or compulsive behaviors associated with excessive \nmasturbation can contribute to performance anxiety and premature ejaculation. \n​ Anxiety: According to a study published in the National Library of Medicine \n(NLM), between 20 to 30% of men suffer from premature ejaculation. The \nsaid study also showed that men suffering from PE also reported other sexual \nproblems associated with an increase in anxiety and interpersonal difficulties. \nAnxiety takes many forms that can result in premature ejaculation. You might \nbe experiencing performance anxiety. This means that you might be afraid that \nyou won’t satisfy the sexual needs of your partner. Or you might feel that your \npartner’s expectations are too high, and you won’t be able to deliver. Some are \nanxious about sexual activities in general. This can be due to inexperience. A \nman might be anxious because he thinks he doesn’t know what to do when it’s \ntime to do the “deed.” \nReference: \nhttps://menshealthclinic.com/au/resource/how-anxiety-impacts-premature-ejaculation-causes-\nand-effects#:~:text=Anxiety%20takes%20many%20forms%20that,t%20be%20able%20to%2\n0deliver \n \n​ Trauma: Trauma activates the body's stress response, leading to the release of \nstress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline. These hormones can disrupt \nnormal sexual function. Individuals who have experienced trauma may have \nheightened arousal states, making it difficult to control the ejaculatory reflex. \nTrauma often leads to anxiety and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). \nThese conditions can increase anxiety levels during sexual activity, \ncontributing to premature ejaculation. Performance Anxiety related to sexual \nperformance can exacerbate the urge to ejaculate prematurely. \n​ Negative Self-perception: Ongoing relationship conflicts can harm \nself-esteem and body image. A negative self-perception can increase stress \nand anxiety during sexual encounters, disrupting normal physiological \nprocesses and contributing to premature ejaculation. \n \n​ Environmental Causes \n \n​ Relationship Issues: Emotional disconnection due to relationship problems \ncan lead to a lack of intimacy and trust.

This emotional gap can cause \nincreased anxiety and decreased sexual satisfaction, which in turn impacts the \nphysiological control over ejaculation.\n\n​ Lack of Privacy: Privacy concerns can heighten anxiety and stress levels, \nwhich are known contributors to premature ejaculation. The constant worry \nabout being overheard or interrupted can make it difficult to relax and enjoy \nthe moment. Knowing that privacy is limited can create performance pressure, \ncausing individuals to rush the sexual experience, leading to premature \nejaculation. The fear of being interrupted or overheard can exacerbate this \npressure. \n \n \nTreatments of Premature Ejaculation \n​ Behavioral Techniques \na.​ Start-Stop Technique: During sexual activity, stimulation is stopped just before the \npoint of no return (ejaculation), then resumed once the urge to ejaculate subsides. \nThis cycle is repeated multiple times before allowing ejaculation. This helps \nincrease control over ejaculation by training the body to delay climax. \n \nb.​ Squeeze Technique: The partner squeezes the penis firmly just below the head (the \nglans) for several seconds until the urge to ejaculate passes. This is repeated \nmultiple times during sexual activity. It reduces the urge to ejaculate and increases \nawareness of the sensation leading to ejaculation. \n \nc.​ Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs): Common SSRIs used are \nParoxetine, Sertraline, Fluoxetine. SSRIs increase serotonin levels in the brain, \nwhich can delay ejaculation and regular use can significantly prolong the time \ntaken to ejaculate. \n \nd.​ Topical Anesthetics: Common anesthetics used are Lidocaine-Prilocaine cream. \nWhen applied to the penis before intercourse, these creams reduce sensitivity by \nnumbing the skin. This delays ejaculation by decreasing penile sensation. \n \n​ Psychological Counseling and Therapy \na.​ Cognitive Behavioral Therapy: CBT addresses negative thought patterns and \nbehaviors that contribute to PE, helping individuals develop healthier sexual \nattitudes and practices. It reduces performance anxiety and improves sexual \nconfidence. \n \nb.​ Sex Therapy: Involves counseling both partners to improve communication and \nsexual techniques, addressing relational factors that contribute to PE. Sex Therapy \nenhances intimacy and reduces stress related to sexual performance. \n \n​ Lifestyle changes \na.​ Regular Exercise: Physical activity reduces stress and improves overall health, \nwhich can positively impact sexual performance by enhancing stamina and \nreducing anxiety.\n\nb.​ Healthy Diet: A balanced diet supports overall hormonal balance and energy \nlevels.

A number\nof medical conditions or injuries, along with their treatments, may produce delays in ejaculation\nindependent of psychosocial and cultural issues.\nDelayed ejaculation must be differentiated from a number of urological conditions\n(especially other ejaculatory disorders), including retrograde ejaculation or anejaculation, which\nis typically the result of etiologies ranging from hormonal to neurological and/or anatomical\nabnormalities, including ejaculatory duct obstruction and other urological disorders.\nA number of pharmacological agents, such as antidepressants,\nantipsychotics, α sympathetic drugs, alcohol, and opioid drugs, can cause ejaculatory problems.\nIn such cases, the diagnosis is substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction instead of\ndelayed ejaculation.\nIt is important in the history to ascertain whether the complaint concerns\ndelayed ejaculation or the sensation of orgasm, or both. Ejaculation occurs in the genitals,\nwhereas the experience of orgasm is believed to be primarily subjective. Ejaculation and orgasm\nusually occur together but not always.

A careful sexual history is necessary to\nascertain that the problem has been present for a significant duration of time (i.e., at least\napproximately 6 months) and occurs on the majority of sexual occasions (i.e., at least 75% of the\ntime). Symptoms may occur only in specific situations involving certain types of stimulation or\npartners, or they may occur in a generalized manner in all types of situations, stimulation, or\npartners.\nThis chapter uses the terms erectile disorder and erectile dysfunction, which are not\nsynonymous. Erectile dysfunction is a widely used descriptive term (including in ICD-10) that\nrefers to difficulty getting and maintaining an erection. Erectile disorder is the more specific\nDSM-5 diagnostic category in which erectile dysfunction persists for at least 6 months and\ncauses distress in the individual.\nAssociated Features\nMany males with erectile disorder may have low self-esteem, low self-confidence, and a\ndecreased sense of masculinity, and may experience depressed mood. Erectile dysfunction is also\nstrongly associated with feelings of guilt, self-blame, sense of failure, anger, and concern about\ndisappointing one’s partner.

There is a strong age-\nrelated increase in both prevalence and incidence of problems with erection, particularly after\nage 50 years. Internationally, the prevalence of erectile disorder in the general population is\napproximately 13%–21% of males ages 40–80 years. Rates appear to be lower than 10% in\nmales younger than 40 years, about 20%–40% in males in their 60s, and 50%–75% in males\nolder than 70 years. In a longitudinal study in Australia, 80% of males age 70 and older\nexperienced erectile disorder. In a review of studies largely from Western countries, about 20%\nof males feared erectile problems on their first sexual experience, whereas approximately 8%\nexperienced erectile problems that hindered penetration during their first sexual experience.\nAmong U.S.-based respondents to an online survey, there was no statistically significant\ndifference in the prevalence of erectile disorder by ethnoracial background. Nationally\nrepresentative U.S. data show that the prevalence of erectile difficulties is similar in older males\nwho have sex with males or with both males and females.\nDevelopment and Course\nErectile failure on first sexual attempt has been found to be related to having sex with a\npreviously unknown partner, concomitant use of drugs or alcohol, not wanting to have sex, and\npeer pressure. There is minimal evidence regarding the persistence of such problems after the\nfirst attempt. It is assumed that most of these problems spontaneously remit without professional\nintervention, but some males may continue to have episodic problems. In contrast, acquired\nerectile disorder is often associated with biological factors such as diabetes and cardiovascular\ndisease. Acquired erectile disorder is likely to be persistent in most men.\nThe natural history of lifelong erectile disorder is unknown. Clinical observation supports the\nassociation of lifelong erectile disorder with psychological factors that are self-limiting or\nresponsive to psychological interventions, whereas, as noted above, acquired erectile disorder is\nmore likely to be related to biological factors and to be persistent.

Distress\nassociated with erectile disorder is lower in older males as compared with younger males.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nRisk factors for acquired erectile dysfunction and, as a consequence, erectile\ndisorder include age, smoking tobacco, lack of physical exercise, diabetes, and decreased desire.\nCulture-Related Diagnostic Issues\nPrevalence of erectile disorder varies across countries. It is unclear to what extent these\nvariations represent differences in cultural expectations as opposed to genuine differences in the\nfrequency of erectile failure. Differential endorsement may be related to cultural concerns about\nappearing weak or less masculine or to diverse cultural norms about changes in erectile function\nduring healthy aging. Cultural expectations concerning marital relationships, sexual\nperformance, fertility, and gender roles can influence anxieties that may contribute to erectile\ndisorder. Based on responses to an online survey, erectile disorder may be associated with\nconcern about genital size in the United States and the Middle East and with fears of male\ninfertility more frequently in the Middle East.\n484\nSex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues\nBy definition, the diagnosis of erectile dysfunction is only given to males. Distressing difficulties\nwith sexual arousal in women would be considered under female sexual interest/arousal disorder.\nDiagnostic Markers\nNocturnal penile tumescence testing and measured erectile turgidity during sleep can be\nemployed to help differentiate organic from psychogenic erectile problems on the assumption\nthat adequate erections during rapid eye movement sleep indicate a psychological etiology to the\nproblem. A number of other diagnostic procedures may be employed depending on the\nclinician’s assessment of their relevance given the individual’s age, comorbid medical problems,\nand clinical presentation. Doppler ultrasonography and intravascular injection of vasoactive\ndrugs, as well as invasive diagnostic procedures such as dynamic infusion cavernosography, can\nbe used to assess vascular integrity. Pudendal nerve conduction studies, including somatosensory\nevoked potentials, can be employed when a peripheral neuropathy is suspected. Testing for low\nlevels of serum bioavailable or free testosterone is appropriate especially when diabetes is\npresent, for men who also experience hypoactive desire, and for those who do not respond to\nphosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors. Thyroid function may also be assessed. Determination of\nfasting serum glucose is useful to screen for the presence of diabetes mellitus.

Elevated suicide rates among males with prostate cancer may in part be\nrelated to treatment-associated erectile dysfunction and consequent depressive symptoms.\nFunctional Consequences of Erectile Disorder\nErectile disorder can interfere with fertility and produce both individual and interpersonal\ndistress. Fear and/or avoidance of sexual encounters may interfere with the ability to develop\nintimate relationships. Significant psychological distress may occur among males presenting\nwith erectile disorder.\nDifferential Diagnosis\nMajor depressive disorder and erectile disorder are closely associated,\nand erectile disorder accompanying severe depressive disorder may occur. If the erectile\ndifficulties are better explained by another mental disorder, such as major depression, then a\ndiagnosis of erectile disorder would not be made.\nThe differential should include consideration of normal erectile function\nin males with excessive expectations.\nAn onset of erectile dysfunction that coincides with the beginning of\nsubstance/medication use and that dissipates with discontinuation of the substance/medication or\ndose reduction is suggestive of a substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction, which\nshould be diagnosed instead of erectile disorder.\n485\nThe most difficult aspect of the differential diagnosis of erectile\ndisorder is ruling out erectile problems that are fully explained by medical factors. Such cases\nwould not receive a diagnosis of a mental disorder. The distinction between erectile disorder as a\nmental disorder and erectile dysfunction as the result of another medical condition is usually\nunclear, and many cases will have complex, interactive biological and psychiatric etiologies. If\nthe individual is older than 40–50 years and/or has concomitant medical problems, the\ndifferential diagnosis should include medical etiologies, especially vascular disease. The\npresence of an organic disease known to cause erectile problems does not confirm a causal\nrelationship. For example, a male with diabetes mellitus can develop erectile disorder in response\nto psychological stress. In general, erectile dysfunction due to organic factors is generalized and\ngradual in onset. An exception would be erectile problems after traumatic injury to the nervous\ninnervation of the genital organs (e.g., spinal cord injury).

    "text": "A 60-second intravaginal ejaculatory latency time was previously\nconsidered to be an appropriate cutoff for the diagnosis of lifelong premature (early) ejaculation\nin men; however, expert consensus now considers this latency time to be too brief and instead\n\nTemperamental.\nGenetic and physiological.\nrecommends a 120-second threshold.\nAssociated Features\nMany males with premature (early) ejaculation complain of a sense of lack of control over\nejaculation and report apprehension about their anticipated inability to delay ejaculation on\nfuture sexual encounters.\nThe following factors may be relevant in the evaluation of any sexual dysfunction: 1) partner\nfactors (e.g., partner’s sexual problems, partner’s health status); 2) relationship factors (e.g., poor\ncommunication, discrepancies in desire for sexual activity); 3) individual vulnerability factors\n(e.g., history of sexual or emotional abuse), psychiatric comorbidity (e.g., depression, anxiety),\nand stressors (e.g., job loss, bereavement); 4) cultural/religious factors (e.g., lack of privacy,\ninhibitions related to prohibitions against sexual activity; attitudes toward sexuality); and 5)\nmedical factors relevant to prognosis, course, or treatment.\n503\nPrevalence\nEstimates of the prevalence of premature (early) ejaculation vary widely depending on the\ndefinition utilized. Internationally, a prevalence range of 8%–30% has been reported across all\nages, with even lower and higher rates in other studies. Prevalence of premature (early)\nejaculation may increase with age. For example, the prevalence among males ages 18–30 in\nSwitzerland and Turkey is about 9%–11%, while the reported prevalence of concern among\nmales ages 50–59 in the United States about how rapidly they ejaculate may be as high as 55%.\nWhen premature (early) ejaculation is defined as ejaculation occurring within approximately 1\nminute of vaginal penetration, only 1%–3% of males would be diagnosed with the disorder.\nDevelopment and Course\nBy definition, lifelong premature (early) ejaculation starts during a male’s initial sexual\nexperiences and persists thereafter. Some males may experience premature (early) ejaculation\nduring their initial sexual encounters but gain ejaculatory control over time. It is the persistence\nof ejaculatory problems for longer than 6 months that determines the diagnosis of premature\n(early) ejaculation. In contrast, some males develop the disorder after a period of having a\nnormal ejaculatory latency, known as acquired premature (early) ejaculation. There is far less\nknown about acquired premature (early) ejaculation than about lifelong premature (early)\nejaculation. The acquired form likely has a later onset, usually appearing during or after the\nfourth decade of life. Lifelong is relatively stable throughout life.\nRisk and Prognostic Factors\nPremature (early) ejaculation may be more common in males with anxiety\ndisorders, especially social anxiety disorder.\nThere is a moderate genetic contribution to lifelong premature (early)\nejaculation. Premature (early) ejaculation may be associated with dopamine transporter gene\npolymorphism or serotonin transporter gene polymorphism. Thyroid disease, prostatitis, and",

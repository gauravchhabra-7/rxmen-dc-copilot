ED Root Causes with Analogies 
 
1. Psychogenic ED (Performance anxiety) –  
Think of your body as a car. When you want a smooth ride, the engine needs to be calm and 
steady. But when you press hard on the accelerator and the brake at the same time, the car jerks 
and stops working properly. 
Getting an erection works a bit like that. When you feel relaxed and safe, your body 
automatically allows blood to flow into the penis — that is the ‘smooth drive’. But if you start 
worrying — ‘Will I be able to get hard?’, ‘Will I satisfy my partner?’ — your brain hits the stress 
pedal. It tells your body to stay alert, not to relax. That stress message tightens blood vessels and 
blocks the process. 
It is the same as when you are about to give an important presentation: your mind races, your 
heart beats faster, your mouth goes dry. In that moment, your body is preparing to perform, not to 
feel pleasure. 
So erectile difficulty in such situations is not a sign of a medical problem — it is your body 
responding to anxiety. Once you learn how to stay calm, comfortable, and focused on pleasure 
rather than performance, the erection usually returns naturally.  
 
2. ED caused by Diabetes – 
Think of a normal glass of water. Now take another glass and add some sugar to it. Is the 
consistency of water the same in both the glasses? No, right. Similar thing happens to your blood 
when the glucose levels rise in the body due to diabetes. The blood flow becomes thick and the 
glucose start accumulating on the blood vessels and they become a bit narrow, thus restricting the 
blood flow and causing erectile issues.  
 
3. ED caused by Hormonal Imbalance –  
● Think of your hormones like a mobile signal between your brain & body. When the 
signal is strong, the messages travel smoothly: your brain says “I’m aroused” and your 
body responds to it. But if the mobile network drops, it’s like a weak signal. It’s like your 
brain is trying to tell “I’m aroused” but the message is getting delivered more slowly.  
● The brain is like the manager, the hormones are the messengers, and the penis is the 
worker. When everyone communicates well, the job gets done. But if the messages are 
missing or unclear — for example, if testosterone is low — the worker doesn’t get proper 
instructions, and performance drops. 
 
4. Situational ED  
● (with certain partners) – Think of your erection like a Wi-Fi signal. The router is your 
body, and the connection depends on both the router and the environment. 
Sometimes, in one room the signal is perfect, but in another, it keeps dropping — not 
because the router is broken, but because of interference, walls, or distance. 
Similarly, your body can work completely fine, but stress, unfamiliarity, or emotional 
tension with a certain partner can weaken the ‘connection’. It’s not a hardware problem 
— it’s about the situation and the emotional signal strength.” 
● (During intercourse only) -  During rehearsal, an actor performs naturally — no one is 
watching. But once the curtain opens and people are watching, sometimes lines are 
forgotten. With certain partners, especially new or intimidating ones, the brain switches 
from pleasure to performance mode. That stress blocks the natural body response, even if 
everything works fine otherwise.

PME Analogies with Root Causes 
 
 
1. Psychological (Performance anxiety) –  
Jab humare upar kisi bhi cheez ka pressure hota hai, toh humari body normally 
respond nahi kar pati hai. For example, agar hum koi exam likh rahe hain, and 
invigilator humare paas aake khada ho and humari answer sheet me dekh rha ho, toh 
hum bohot conscious ho jate hain jiski wajah se possibility hai ki hum ya toh galat 
answer likh dete hain ya ekdum blank ho jate hain. Ye humari body ka ek coping 
mechanism hota hai.. Similarly, jab hum intercourse kar rahe hote hain, and humare 
brain pe ek unusual pressure hota hai apni performance ka – kya me kar paunga? 
Meri partner kya sochegi etc., toh humari body normally respond nahi kar pati hai aur 
hum jaldi se ejaculate kar dete hain as a response mechanism for anxiety.  
 
2. Porn/Masturbation Addiction –  
While masturbating, everything is under our control – hume kaisi grip chahiye, hume 
kaisi speed chahiye ya hume kya content dekh ke masturbate karna hai.. toh humari 
body aur humare mind ki vo aadat ban jati hai and hum comfortably masturbate 
karlete hain.. But jab hum kisi partner ke sath hote hain, tab kaafi cheezein humare 
control me nahi hoti hai because there’s another person involved. Jab hum humare 
comfort zone se bahar hote hain toh quick ejaculation ke chances badh jate hain.. Aur 
agar hum zyada masturbate karte hain and sex occasionally hota hai toh mann me 
excitement aur arousal usual se zyada hota hai aur hum iss high excitement ke wajah 
se jaldi ejaculate kar dete hain..  
 
3. Weak nerves/Hypersensitivity –  
High sensitivity ki wajah se humare penis me ek discomfort paida hota hai jiski 
wajah se early discharge ho jata hai. For example, agar mujhe hath me injury hui hai 
aur koi mujhe uss injury pe touch karega to vo sensation me tolerate nahi kar paungi 
aur apna haath jhatka se wahan se hata lungi like a reflex action.. Jaise agar aap galti 
se koi hot vessel ko touch karte ho toh aapka haath jhatka se wapis piche aajata hai.. 
aapka brain uss cheez ko process karne ke liye zyada time nahi deta aur nervous 
system directly uspe action le leta hai.. Similar cheez hoti hai aapke ejaculation ke 
sath.  
 
4. Situational Factors – 
Most commonly lack of privacy. For example agar koi robbery karta hai, aur usko 
pakde jane ka darr hota hai, toh us’se anxiety bhi badhti hai and vo already ek rush 
me hota hai to finish the task and leave. Same way me humari body bhi react karti hai 
aise situational/environmental factors me. 
Painful sex for partner  - agar aapki partner ko pain horha hai sex me toh aap bhi vo 
pleasure enjoy  nahi kar payenge, Kahin na Kahin ek guilt factor humare mind me 
aajata hai and then your brain rush towards ending the intercourse quickly.

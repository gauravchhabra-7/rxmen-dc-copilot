For the medications -  
I’m going to start medicines for a short period of time for a better hormonal imbalance and the 
initial boost, but my target would be that we don’t take medicines for more than 2 months (varies 
depending on the treatment plan pitched). Medicines starting me required rahegi but medicines 
are never a permanent cure for this and I don’t want you to be taking a lot of meds or getting 
dependent on it because of course for the coming 20 years (varies depending on the patient’s 
age) of your sex life you can’t take a pill everytime for having sex. It’s not possible, it’s not 
advisable either. So for the permanent cure I’ll be starting your sex therapy sessions. -  
How to explain Sex therapy: 
1. If the root cause is psychogenic - Performance Anxiety: In sex therapy we are going to 
learn how to manage that performance anxiety in a healthy way and boost the 
confidence again from a proper intercourse. Jab aapko andar se confidence feel hoga 
that you can do it, toh automatically aap better perform karne lagoge.. kabhi kabhi we 
get distracted a lot with pre-occupied thoughts jaise kya me kar paunga ya meri partner 
kya sochegi; so aise situations me hum mindfulness practice karke sirf pleasure pe focus 
karna seekhenge taki future me kabhi low confidence ki wajah se sexual life ya 
relationship kharab na ho. 
2. Stress - Stress also affects our sexual performance by impacting testosterone levels. 
Stress is always going to be a part of life and we can’t change that.. but what we can 
change is how we deal with that stress. Sex therapy me aapko proper guidance milegi 
healthy coping mechanisms ke baare me jiski help se aap stress ko better way me 
manage kar paoge, mind aur muscle ka connection better hoga and sexual performance 
improve hogi plus overall quality of life bhi better hogi.  
 If the root cause is physiological  
3.  Weak pelvic floor muscles - Sex therapy me hum different exercises aur techniques 
sikhenge jo especially aapke pelvic floor muscles and penis muscles ke liye designed hoti hai.. 
jaise gym me trainers hote hain humare different muscles ko train karne ke liye, but pelvic floor 
muscles ki guidance koi nhi deta hai jo ki bohot important hota hai.. so sex therapy/performance 
coaching me focus karenge inn muscles ko strong karne me, sensitivity ko control karne me (if 
pme case). Agar zyada baithe rehne ka kaam hota hai toh ofcourse hum vo change nahi kar 
sakte hain, but kuch kuch exercises aisi bhi hoti hai jo aap apni chair pe baithe baithe bhi kar 
sakte ho aur muscles repair bhi hote jayenge. Stronger muscles = stronger erections and better 
timing.  
If the root cause is behavioural- 
4. Behavioural factors - Habit formation/lifestyle changes.. Sex therapy ke through hum 
seekhenge hume kuch time ke liye kya routines follow karne hain, agar kuch dietary changes 
karne ki requirement hai ya kya kya precautions lene hai taki ye problems aage jake permanent 
na ho jaye. In fact, kuch kuch particular sex positions bhi hoti hai jisme timing aur erections

better hote hain jiske baare me yaha india me koi sikhata hi nhi hai.. so yahan aapki ek proper 
training hogi aapke sexual performance ke liye and overall well-being ke liye bhi.  
In this way it will be a holistic approach for your health giving permanent cure.  
 
Note - The crux and essence of sex therapy remains the same - Physical, Psychological and 
Behavioural. The main difference is the point where we need to emphasise according to the 
patient and the root cause.

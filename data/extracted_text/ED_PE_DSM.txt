differentiating between a delayed ejaculation that is fully explained by another medical condition
or injury (or its treatment) and a delayed ejaculation attributable to a variety of proportionally
different biomedical-psychosocial and cultural factors that determine the symptom(s). A number
of medical conditions or injuries, along with their treatments, may produce delays in ejaculation
independent of psychosocial and cultural issues.
Delayed ejaculation must be differentiated from a number of urological conditions
(especially other ejaculatory disorders), including retrograde ejaculation or anejaculation, which
is typically the result of etiologies ranging from hormonal to neurological and/or anatomical
abnormalities, including ejaculatory duct obstruction and other urological disorders.
A number of pharmacological agents, such as antidepressants,
antipsychotics, α sympathetic drugs, alcohol, and opioid drugs, can cause ejaculatory problems.
In such cases, the diagnosis is substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction instead of
delayed ejaculation.
It is important in the history to ascertain whether the complaint concerns
delayed ejaculation or the sensation of orgasm, or both. Ejaculation occurs in the genitals,
whereas the experience of orgasm is believed to be primarily subjective. Ejaculation and orgasm
usually occur together but not always. For example, a male with a normal ejaculatory pattern
may complain of decreased pleasure (i.e., anhedonic ejaculation). Such a complaint would not be
coded as delayed ejaculation but could be coded as other specified sexual dysfunction or
unspecified sexual dysfunction.
Comorbidity
There is some evidence to suggest that delayed ejaculation may be more common in severe
forms of major depressive disorder.

Diagnostic Features
The essential feature of erectile disorder is a marked difficulty in obtaining or maintaining an
erection or a marked decrease in erectile rigidity in all or almost all occasions of sexual activity
(Criterion A) that has persisted for at least 6 months (Criterion B) and that causes clinically
significant distress in the individual (Criterion C). A careful sexual history is necessary to
ascertain that the problem has been present for a significant duration of time (i.e., at least
approximately 6 months) and occurs on the majority of sexual occasions (i.e., at least 75% of the
time). Symptoms may occur only in specific situations involving certain types of stimulation or
partners, or they may occur in a generalized manner in all types of situations, stimulation, or
partners.
This chapter uses the terms erectile disorder and erectile dysfunction, which are not
synonymous. Erectile dysfunction is a widely used descriptive term (including in ICD-10) that
refers to difficulty getting and maintaining an erection. Erectile disorder is the more specific
DSM-5 diagnostic category in which erectile dysfunction persists for at least 6 months and
causes distress in the individual.
Associated Features
Many males with erectile disorder may have low self-esteem, low self-confidence, and a
decreased sense of masculinity, and may experience depressed mood. Erectile dysfunction is also
strongly associated with feelings of guilt, self-blame, sense of failure, anger, and concern about
disappointing one’s partner. Fear and/or avoidance of future sexual encounters may occur.
Decreased sexual satisfaction and reduced sexual desire in the individual’s partner are common.
In addition to considerations of applicable subtypes (i.e., whether the erectile dysfunction has

============================================================

============================================================

been present since the individual became sexually active or began after a period of relatively
normal sexual function, and whether the erectile dysfunction is generalized or occurs only with
certain types of stimulation, situations, or partners), the following factors are important to
consider in the assessment of erectile disorder: 1) partner factors (e.g., partner’s sexual problems
or health); 2) relationship factors (e.g., poor communication, discrepancies in desire for sexual
activity); 3) individual vulnerability factors (e.g., hypoactive sexual desire), psychiatric
comorbidity (e.g., depression, anxiety), or stressors such as job loss or stress; 4) cultural/religious
factors (e.g., inhibitions related to prohibitions against sexual activity; attitudes toward
sexuality); 5) medical factors, particularly surgery (e.g., transurethral resection of the prostate),
hypogonadism, or neurological conditions
483
(e.g., multiple sclerosis, diabetic neuropathy); and 6) use of substances or medications that
might inhibit ejaculation (e.g., use of serotonergic drugs).
Prevalence
The prevalence of lifelong versus acquired erectile disorder is unknown. There is a strong age-
related increase in both prevalence and incidence of problems with erection, particularly after
age 50 years. Internationally, the prevalence of erectile disorder in the general population is
approximately 13%–21% of males ages 40–80 years. Rates appear to be lower than 10% in
males younger than 40 years, about 20%–40% in males in their 60s, and 50%–75% in males
older than 70 years. In a longitudinal study in Australia, 80% of males age 70 and older
experienced erectile disorder. In a review of studies largely from Western countries, about 20%
of males feared erectile problems on their first sexual experience, whereas approximately 8%
experienced erectile problems that hindered penetration during their first sexual experience.
Among U.S.-based respondents to an online survey, there was no statistically significant
difference in the prevalence of erectile disorder by ethnoracial background. Nationally
representative U.S. data show that the prevalence of erectile difficulties is similar in older males
who have sex with males or with both males and females.
Development and Course
Erectile failure on first sexual attempt has been found to be related to having sex with a
previously unknown partner, concomitant use of drugs or alcohol, not wanting to have sex, and
peer pressure. There is minimal evidence regarding the persistence of such problems after the
first attempt. It is assumed that most of these problems spontaneously remit without professional
intervention, but some males may continue to have episodic problems. In contrast, acquired
erectile disorder is often associated with biological factors such as diabetes and cardiovascular
disease. Acquired erectile disorder is likely to be persistent in most men.
The natural history of lifelong erectile disorder is unknown. Clinical observation supports the
association of lifelong erectile disorder with psychological factors that are self-limiting or
responsive to psychological interventions, whereas, as noted above, acquired erectile disorder is
more likely to be related to biological factors and to be persistent. The incidence of erectile
disorder increases with age. A minority of males diagnosed as having moderate erectile failure

may experience spontaneous remission of symptoms without medical intervention. Distress
associated with erectile disorder is lower in older males as compared with younger males.
Risk and Prognostic Factors
Risk factors for acquired erectile dysfunction and, as a consequence, erectile
disorder include age, smoking tobacco, lack of physical exercise, diabetes, and decreased desire.
Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues
Prevalence of erectile disorder varies across countries. It is unclear to what extent these
variations represent differences in cultural expectations as opposed to genuine differences in the
frequency of erectile failure. Differential endorsement may be related to cultural concerns about
appearing weak or less masculine or to diverse cultural norms about changes in erectile function
during healthy aging. Cultural expectations concerning marital relationships, sexual
performance, fertility, and gender roles can influence anxieties that may contribute to erectile
disorder. Based on responses to an online survey, erectile disorder may be associated with
concern about genital size in the United States and the Middle East and with fears of male
infertility more frequently in the Middle East.
484
Sex- and Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues
By definition, the diagnosis of erectile dysfunction is only given to males. Distressing difficulties
with sexual arousal in women would be considered under female sexual interest/arousal disorder.
Diagnostic Markers
Nocturnal penile tumescence testing and measured erectile turgidity during sleep can be
employed to help differentiate organic from psychogenic erectile problems on the assumption
that adequate erections during rapid eye movement sleep indicate a psychological etiology to the
problem. A number of other diagnostic procedures may be employed depending on the
clinician’s assessment of their relevance given the individual’s age, comorbid medical problems,
and clinical presentation. Doppler ultrasonography and intravascular injection of vasoactive
drugs, as well as invasive diagnostic procedures such as dynamic infusion cavernosography, can
be used to assess vascular integrity. Pudendal nerve conduction studies, including somatosensory
evoked potentials, can be employed when a peripheral neuropathy is suspected. Testing for low
levels of serum bioavailable or free testosterone is appropriate especially when diabetes is
present, for men who also experience hypoactive desire, and for those who do not respond to
phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors. Thyroid function may also be assessed. Determination of
fasting serum glucose is useful to screen for the presence of diabetes mellitus. The assessment of
serum lipids is important, as erectile disorder in males 40 years and older is predictive of the
future risk for coronary artery disease.
Association With Suicidal Thoughts or Behavior
Among males receiving treatment for erectile disorder with comorbid depression, elevated rates

of suicidal thoughts or behavior have been observed; while the affected males attributed the
suicidal symptoms to their erectile disorder, the presence of depression was also a likely
contributing factor. Elevated suicide rates among males with prostate cancer may in part be
related to treatment-associated erectile dysfunction and consequent depressive symptoms.
Functional Consequences of Erectile Disorder
Erectile disorder can interfere with fertility and produce both individual and interpersonal
distress. Fear and/or avoidance of sexual encounters may interfere with the ability to develop
intimate relationships. Significant psychological distress may occur among males presenting
with erectile disorder.
Differential Diagnosis
Major depressive disorder and erectile disorder are closely associated,
and erectile disorder accompanying severe depressive disorder may occur. If the erectile
difficulties are better explained by another mental disorder, such as major depression, then a
diagnosis of erectile disorder would not be made.
The differential should include consideration of normal erectile function
in males with excessive expectations.
An onset of erectile dysfunction that coincides with the beginning of
substance/medication use and that dissipates with discontinuation of the substance/medication or
dose reduction is suggestive of a substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction, which
should be diagnosed instead of erectile disorder.
485
The most difficult aspect of the differential diagnosis of erectile
disorder is ruling out erectile problems that are fully explained by medical factors. Such cases
would not receive a diagnosis of a mental disorder. The distinction between erectile disorder as a
mental disorder and erectile dysfunction as the result of another medical condition is usually
unclear, and many cases will have complex, interactive biological and psychiatric etiologies. If
the individual is older than 40–50 years and/or has concomitant medical problems, the
differential diagnosis should include medical etiologies, especially vascular disease. The
presence of an organic disease known to cause erectile problems does not confirm a causal
relationship. For example, a male with diabetes mellitus can develop erectile disorder in response
to psychological stress. In general, erectile dysfunction due to organic factors is generalized and
gradual in onset. An exception would be erectile problems after traumatic injury to the nervous
innervation of the genital organs (e.g., spinal cord injury). Erectile problems that are situational
and inconsistent and that have an acute onset after a stressful life event are most often
attributable to psychological events. An age younger than 40 years is also suggestive of a
psychological etiology to the difficulty.
Comorbidity
Erectile disorder can be comorbid with other sexual diagnoses, such as premature (early)

compared with women. However, preliminary data suggest that the overlap between sexual
desire and sexual arousal (erectile function) is also very common in men, particularly when they
present for help regarding sexual problems. Regarding sexual orientation, data suggest that low
sexual desire is more commonly reported by gay men (19%) than by heterosexual men (9%).
Differential Diagnosis
Nonsexual mental disorders, such as major depressive disorder,
which is characterized by “markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all,
activities,” may explain the lack of sexual desire. If the lack of desire is better explained by
another mental disorder, then a diagnosis of male hypoactive sexual desire disorder would not be
made.
An onset of male hypoactive sexual desire that coincides with the
beginning of substance/medication use and that dissipates with discontinuation of the
substance/medication or dose reduction is suggestive of a substance/medication-induced sexual
dysfunction, which should be diagnosed instead of male hypoactive sexual desire disorder.
If the low/absent desire and deficient/absent erotic thoughts or
fantasies are better explained by the effects of another medical condition (e.g., hypogonadism,
diabetes mellitus, thyroid dysfunction, central nervous system disease), then a diagnosis of male
hypoactive sexual desire disorder would not be made.
If interpersonal or significant contextual factors, such as severe relationship
distress or other significant stressors, are associated with the loss of desire in the man, then a
diagnosis of male hypoactive sexual desire disorder would not be made.
The presence of another sexual dysfunction does not rule out a
diagnosis of male hypoactive sexual desire disorder; there is some evidence that up to one-half of
men with low sexual desire also have erectile difficulties, and slightly fewer may also have early
ejaculation difficulties. If the man’s low desire is explained by self-identification as an asexual,
then a diagnosis of male hypoactive sexual desire disorder is not made.
Comorbidity
Male hypoactive sexual desire disorder is rarely the sole sexual diagnosis in men. Erectile
dysfunction, delayed ejaculation, and premature (early) ejaculation are often comorbid
diagnoses. Depression and other mental disorders, as well as endocrinological factors, are often
comorbid with male hypoactive sexual desire disorder.
Premature (Early) Ejaculation
Diagnostic Criteria
A. A persistent or recurrent pattern of ejaculation occurring during partnered sexual
activity within approximately 1 minute following vaginal penetration and before
the individual wishes it.

Note: Although the diagnosis of premature (early) ejaculation may be applied to
individuals engaged in nonvaginal sexual activities, specific duration criteria have
not been established for these activities.
B. The symptom in Criterion A must have been present for at least 6 months and
must be experienced on almost all or all (approximately 75%–100%) occasions
of sexual activity (in identified situational contexts or, if generalized, in all
contexts).
C. The symptom in Criterion A causes clinically significant distress in the individual.
D. The sexual dysfunction is not better explained by a nonsexual mental disorder or
as a consequence of severe relationship distress or other significant stressors
and is not attributable to the effects of a substance/medication or another
medical condition.
Specify whether:
Lifelong: The disturbance has been present since the individual became
sexually active.
Acquired: The disturbance began after a period of relatively normal sexual
function.
Specify whether:
Generalized: Not limited to certain types of stimulation, situations, or partners.
Situational: Only occurs with certain types of stimulation, situations, or partners.
Specify current severity:
Mild: Ejaculation occurring within approximately 30 seconds to 1 minute of
vaginal penetration.
Moderate: Ejaculation occurring within approximately 15–30 seconds of vaginal
penetration.
Severe: Ejaculation occurring prior to sexual activity, at the start of sexual
activity, or within approximately 15 seconds of vaginal penetration.
Diagnostic Features
Premature (early) ejaculation is manifested by ejaculation that occurs prior to or shortly after
vaginal penetration, operationalized by an individual’s estimate of ejaculatory latency (i.e.,
elapsed time before ejaculation) after vaginal penetration. Although the diagnostic criteria
specify penile-vaginal sex, it is reasonable to assume that similar estimates of ejaculatory latency
apply to males having sex with males, as well as to other sexual behaviors. Estimated and
measured intravaginal ejaculatory latencies are highly correlated as long as the ejaculatory
latency is of short duration; therefore, self-reported estimates of ejaculatory latency are sufficient
for diagnostic purposes. A 60-second intravaginal ejaculatory latency time was previously
considered to be an appropriate cutoff for the diagnosis of lifelong premature (early) ejaculation
in men; however, expert consensus now considers this latency time to be too brief and instead

recommends a 120-second threshold.
Associated Features
Many males with premature (early) ejaculation complain of a sense of lack of control over
ejaculation and report apprehension about their anticipated inability to delay ejaculation on
future sexual encounters.
The following factors may be relevant in the evaluation of any sexual dysfunction: 1) partner
factors (e.g., partner’s sexual problems, partner’s health status); 2) relationship factors (e.g., poor
communication, discrepancies in desire for sexual activity); 3) individual vulnerability factors
(e.g., history of sexual or emotional abuse), psychiatric comorbidity (e.g., depression, anxiety),
and stressors (e.g., job loss, bereavement); 4) cultural/religious factors (e.g., lack of privacy,
inhibitions related to prohibitions against sexual activity; attitudes toward sexuality); and 5)
medical factors relevant to prognosis, course, or treatment.
503
Prevalence
Estimates of the prevalence of premature (early) ejaculation vary widely depending on the
definition utilized. Internationally, a prevalence range of 8%–30% has been reported across all
ages, with even lower and higher rates in other studies. Prevalence of premature (early)
ejaculation may increase with age. For example, the prevalence among males ages 18–30 in
Switzerland and Turkey is about 9%–11%, while the reported prevalence of concern among
males ages 50–59 in the United States about how rapidly they ejaculate may be as high as 55%.
When premature (early) ejaculation is defined as ejaculation occurring within approximately 1
minute of vaginal penetration, only 1%–3% of males would be diagnosed with the disorder.
Development and Course
By definition, lifelong premature (early) ejaculation starts during a male’s initial sexual
experiences and persists thereafter. Some males may experience premature (early) ejaculation
during their initial sexual encounters but gain ejaculatory control over time. It is the persistence
of ejaculatory problems for longer than 6 months that determines the diagnosis of premature
(early) ejaculation. In contrast, some males develop the disorder after a period of having a
normal ejaculatory latency, known as acquired premature (early) ejaculation. There is far less
known about acquired premature (early) ejaculation than about lifelong premature (early)
ejaculation. The acquired form likely has a later onset, usually appearing during or after the
fourth decade of life. Lifelong is relatively stable throughout life.
Risk and Prognostic Factors
Premature (early) ejaculation may be more common in males with anxiety
disorders, especially social anxiety disorder.
There is a moderate genetic contribution to lifelong premature (early)
ejaculation. Premature (early) ejaculation may be associated with dopamine transporter gene
polymorphism or serotonin transporter gene polymorphism. Thyroid disease, prostatitis, and
